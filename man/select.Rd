\title{Select solutions from a solution path}
\usage{
select(x, edges, lambda, index)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{\link{sparsebnPath}} object.}

\item{edges}{number of edges to search for.}

\item{lambda}{value of regularization parameter to search for.}

\item{index}{integer index to select.}
}
\description{
Choose solutions from a solution path based on number of edges, value of
regularization parameter lambda, or index.
}
\details{
For \code{edges} (resp. \code{lambda}), the solution with the closest number
of edges (resp. regularization parameter) is returned. If there is no match
within a tolerance of 0.1 for \code{lambda}, nothing is returned. Fuzzy matching
is not used for when selecting by \code{index}.

If there is more than one match (for example, by number of edges), then
the first such estimate is returned. Note that \code{select(x, index = j)}
is equivalent to (but slightly slower than) \code{x[[j]]}.
